# Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning

## Description

This project will track my progress through the book _"Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning for Programmers"_ by _Frances Buontempo_. The link to the accompanying website for the book:

    https://pragprog.com/titles/fbmach/genetic-algorithms-and-machine-learning-for-programmers/

The book is structured as having a problem to solve for each chapter. The reader will be using techniques with machine learning and especially genetic algorithms to create efficient solutions.

This project will be structured quite differently than any other project on my GitHub. Each chapter will be given a section in this README, with a description/summary, insights gained, personal challenges (because even following along with a book involves troubleshooting), and any other thoughts I have for the chapter.
